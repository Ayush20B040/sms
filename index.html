        <h2>Steel Making Process</h2>
        <p>The steel-making process involves several key steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ironmaking:</strong> Raw materials like iron ore, coke, and limestone are converted into molten iron in a blast furnace.</li>
            <li><strong>Basic Oxygen Steelmaking:</strong> Molten iron is converted into steel by blowing oxygen through it in a basic oxygen furnace.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Metallurgy:</strong> The steel is further refined to achieve the desired chemical composition and temperature.</li>
            <li><strong>Casting:</strong> The molten steel is solidified into semi-finished products like billets, blooms, or slabs.</li>
            <li><strong>Hot Rolling:</strong> The semi-finished products are rolled at high temperatures to produce finished products like sheets, plates, and bars.</li>
            <li><strong>Cold Rolling:</strong> The hot-rolled products are further processed at room temperature to achieve precise dimensions and surface finishes.</li>
        </ul>
